For everything, except Infersent:
Python 2.7

python libraries:
gensim
nltk
stopwords
numpy
pyemd

Just only for InferSent:
numpy
pytorch, which can only be installed on Linux or OSX (see http://pytorch.org/ and https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#installation)

Thus, InferSent can't run on Windows operation systems at all, because of pytorch's limitations.
